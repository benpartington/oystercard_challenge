#touch_out
#card.balance(4)

step 11
#in irb:
#create new oystercard
#top_up(5)
#touch_in
#touch_out
#card.entry_station

# test expected functionality in IRB done
# write rspec test using a double 
# update code to to accept entry_station 
# review existing rspec tests and update, to accept a touch in argument
